## üìã Project Overview

This project replaces inefficient, manual leave tracking (via spreadsheets and emails) with a fully automated workflow. Using Airtable as a smart database and Zapier and Airtable Automations as the logic engines, this system provides a centralized, error-proof, and transparent process for managing employee Paid Time Off (PTO).

The system handles request submissions, validates them against available balances, routes valid requests to managers for approval, and keeps all stakeholders notified in real-time.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Centralized Request Management:** All leave requests are submitted and tracked in one place.
-   **Real-Time PTO Balance Calculation:** Employee PTO balances are automatically updated upon approval of a request.
-   **Automated Annual Reset:** On January 1st of each year, all employee PTO balances automatically reset to the annual allowance with zero manual intervention.
-   **Intelligent Request Validation:** The system automatically checks if a request exceeds the employee's available balance. Invalid requests are instantly rejected and the employee is notified.
-   **Seamless Notification Workflow:** Managers are notified of valid pending requests, and employees are notified of the final decision (approved or rejected).
-   **Professional Email Sender:** All automated emails are sent from a custom email address (via Gmail/Outlook integration) instead of a generic no-reply address.
