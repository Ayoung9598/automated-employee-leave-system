# automated-employee-leave-system
I designed and built a fully automated employee time-off management system to solve the challenges of manual leave tracking. Using Airtable as a database and Zapier and Airtable Automations for the logic, the system centralizes all requests, automates manager and employee notifications, and maintains real-time PTO balances.
